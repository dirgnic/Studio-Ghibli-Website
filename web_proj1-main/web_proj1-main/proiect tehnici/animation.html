                        <h2>Idea Development</h2>
                        <p>The animation process at Studio Ghibli begins with the development of ideas. This involves brainstorming and conceptualizing the storyline, characters, and themes for the film.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h2>Script Writing</h2>
                        <p>Once the ideas are finalized, the scriptwriting phase begins. A detailed script is created, outlining the entire story, including scenes, dialogue, and character interactions.</p>

                        <p>After the script is completed, a storyboard is created. This serves as a visual representation of the script, illustrating key frames and basic movements of the film.</p>

                        <h2>Character Design</h2>
                        <p>Following the storyboard, characters and their costumes are designed. The way characters dress is used to reveal their personality, place in society, and the time period the film is set in.</p>

            <br>
            <p class="section-paragraph">Similar to other films, every creation from Studio Ghibli originates from an initial idea. This concept is subsequently crafted into a script that delineates the entire narrative, encompassing scenes and dialogue, thereby ensuring alignment among all team members.</p>
            <img src="img/script_1.jpg" class="section-image" alt="history5"> 
            <br>
            <p class="section-paragraph">Following this, it is essential to develop the characters and their attire. The clothing choices of characters serve as a means to unveil their personality traits, social standing, and the specific era depicted in the film.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/character-design_2.jpg" class="section-image" alt="history6">
            <br>
            <p class="section-paragraph">Once the characters are designed, the next step involves creating a storyboard. This serves as a visual roadmap for the entire film, outlining key scenes and transitions.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/storyboard_3.jpg" class="section-image" alt="history7">
            <br>
            <p class="section-paragraph">With the storyboard as a guide, animators begin sketching out each scene frame by frame. This meticulous process forms the foundation for the animation sequence.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/sketching-4.jpg" class="section-image" alt="history8">
            <br>
            <p class="section-paragraph">Simultaneously, intricate backgrounds are crafted to complement the characters and enhance the visual appeal of each scene.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/background_6.jpg" class="section-image" alt="history9">
            <br>
            <p class="section-paragraph">Once all elements are prepared, each frame is shot individually, capturing the essence of the animation.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/shot-individually_7.jpg" class="section-image" alt="history10">
            <br>
            <p class="section-paragraph">Subsequently, voices are recorded to synchronize with the animation, ensuring seamless dialogue delivery.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/prerecorded-voices_8.jpg" class="section-image" alt="history11">
            <br>
            <p class="section-paragraph">The final stage involves meticulous editing and matching up the animation with the recorded voices to achieve synchronization.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/matching-up_9.jpg" class="section-image" alt="history12">
            <br>
            <p class="section-paragraph">Upon completion, the film is developed and prepared for distribution to the audience.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/developed-film_10.jpg" class="section-image" alt="history2">
            <br>
            <p class="section-paragraph">Additionally, the film's soundtrack and theme music are recorded to enhance the overall viewing experience.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/music-recording_10.jpg" class="section-image" alt="history3">
